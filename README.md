# Face Generator
A model to generate face images that would look like a kpopstar (similar to This Person Does not Exist)
## Current progress
Generates a very very blurry image that almost represents a face (e.g. can see where the eyes and other facial features exist)
## Work in progress
Switch to a more advanced generative model (e.g. more advanced VAE tailored to face generation or GAN)

Current speculation is that in comparison to other face-datasets my dataset has multiple face angles which make it harder to generalize
since the face location is not uniform and the face direction is not uniform
