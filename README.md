# Face Generator
A model to generate face images that would look like a kpopstar (similar to This Person Does not Exist)
## Current progress
Generates a very very blurry image that almost represents a face (e.g. can see where the eyes and other facial features exist)
Gathered more data and it seems to be producing better images for the VAE.
## Work in progress
Test gan on new dataset that has more images.
